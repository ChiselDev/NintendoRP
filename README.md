# NintendoRPC
A rich-presence for Discord that shows what you're playing on a Nintendo platform!

This will support (when out): Switch and Nintendo 3DS! (and maybe Wii?)

There will be a friendly user interface for the program, in which you can select the platform and then select the game.
The presence will show the platform icon (small) and the game image (large), along with the platform title and game title!
(Example: [placeholder])
